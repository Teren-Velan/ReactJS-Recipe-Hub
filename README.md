## About The Project
<img width="1777" alt="titlepage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63656708/98432235-46b1cb00-20f7-11eb-9a60-636edf226f55.png">

As part of my second project at General Assembly, I created a front-end Recipe Website
. 
Taste the World is a Recipe Website to provide users with recipes from around the world and recipes of different dietary preferences

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
* [Edamam API](https://www.edamam.com/)


## Usage

The webpage consist of 3 Main components:
1.Search Bar
2.Cuisine/Diet/Meal type display
3.My Cookbook

Each will be further elaborated with images below

### 1. Search Bar

<p> The search bar allows users to search for any recipes. </p>

Key learning pointer from building the search bar was using the UseQuery function to obtain the word typed by the user and using that as the input for the API call.


### 2.Cuisine/Diet/Meal type display

The recipe display page shows the user which ever recipe they choose based on their selection.

Lets look more indepth into each recipe card:

The "Read More" button opens a new page which shows the ingredient list and more about the recipe
The Add to Cookbook will add the recipe to a seperate page for future viewing. This will be further elaboarted in the subsequent point

Key learning pointer from this was the use of API calls and styling with Bootstrap coupled with CSS 

### 3.My Cookbook

<img width="1777" alt="usage3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63656708/98432649-3bf93500-20fb-11eb-93eb-42053c1ffbe0.png">

The "My Cookbook" component allows user to create their own cooking book with recipes they choose, this creates a more personalized expereince for the user.

Key learning pointer from this was using states to update the list of recipes in the cookbook, building this component gave me a much better understanding of using states.
